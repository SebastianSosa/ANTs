\description{
Cumulative pre-network permutation on association data of gambit of the group type without control factor.
}
\details{
Data stream permutations is a pre-network permutations approach. It is use on association data based on the gambit of the group. This permutations functunction is made for  data collected of the type of 'gambit of the group' and without control factors
