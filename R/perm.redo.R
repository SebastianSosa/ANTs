#' @title Repeats a permutation according to random factors
#' @description Performs node label permutations for GLMM by intra random factor label permutations.
#' @param df a list of data frame with each data frame representing a subset of the random factors (e.g. groups and/or periods)
#' @param labels a numeric or character vector representing the labels to permute.
#' @param ctrl a numeric or character vector representing one or more columns that will be use as control facors.
#' @return a data frame in which the data frames of the list are merged, each data frame being permuted according to the input argument labels.
#' @details This is a function to repeat a permutation according to random factors. It allows to handle GLMM warnings or errors that may appear due to the permutation approach.
