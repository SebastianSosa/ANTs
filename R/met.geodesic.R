#' @title Geodesic distances
#' @description Calculates the geodesic distances of a network.

#' @param M a square adjacency matrix, or a list of square adjacency matrices, or an output of ANT functions \emph{stat.ds.grp}, \emph{stat.df.focal}, \emph{stat.net.lk}.
#' @param weighted if \emph{true}, it binarizes the square adjacency matrix M. Geodesic distances and diameter are based only on the presence or absence of edges.
#' @param shortest.weight if \emph{false}, it considers the highest met.strength as the shortest path.
#' @param normalization normalizes the weights of the links i.e. divides them by the average strength of the network. Argument normalization can't be TRUE when argument weighted is FALSE.
#' @param directed if \emph{false}, then it symmetrizes the matrix. Otherwise, it calculates geodesic distances and diameter according to the directionality of the links.
#' @param out if \emph{true}, it considers outgoing ties.
#' @return
#' \itemize{
#' \item a matrix representing the geodesic distances of the network if argument \emph{M} is a square matrix.
#' \item A list of matrices if argument \emph{M} is a list of matrices. Each matrix represents the geodesic distances of the corresponding matrix of the list.
#' }
#' @details Binary network met.density is the ratio of existing links of a network in relation to all potential links.
