#' @title Imports matrices
#' @description  Imports all current directory filesin the format of a list of matrices.
#' @param header a logical value indicating whether the file contains the names of the variables as its first line. If missing, the value is determined from the file format: header is set to TRUE if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns.
#' @param row.names a vector of row names. This can be a vector giving the actual row names, or a single number giving the column of the table which contains the row names, or character string giving the name of the table column containing the row names.
#' If there is a header and the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns, the first column in the input is used for the row names. Otherwise if row.names is missing, the rows are numbered.
#' Using row.names = NULL forces row numbering. Missing or NULL row.names generate row names that are considered to be 'automatic' (and not preserved by as.matrix).
#' @param sep the field separator character. Values on each line of the file are separated by this character. If sep = "" (the default for read.table) the separator is 'white space', that is one or more spaces, tabs, newlines or carriage returns.
#' @param ... Further arguments to be passed to code 'read.csv'.
#' @details  returns a single matrix if there is only one file in the folder or a list of matrices in the same order as in the original folder.
#' By default, it considers that the matrix has header and row names=1.
#' It also orders the matrix according to row names.
#' @return  a single matrix or a list of matrices according to the number of files in the selected folder.
