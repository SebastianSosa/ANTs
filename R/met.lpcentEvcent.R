#' @title Laplacian centrality
#' @description Calculate the directed weighted or binary Laplacian centrality for each verteces.

#' @param M a square adjacency matrix.
#' @param binary if if \emph{true}  then calculate the directed binary version of Laplacian centrality

#' @details Laplacian centrality is the drop in the Laplacian energy of the graph when the vertex is removed
#' This version uses the eigenvalues to calculate laplacian centrality
