#' @title Data stream permutation for association data
#' @description Pre-network permutation on association data for gambit of the group data collection protocol. The data frame must have a column named 'ID'.
#' @param df A data frame.The data frame must have a column named 'ID'.
#' @param scan  an integer indicating the column of scans of individual associations.
#' @param ctrlf A confounding factor by which to control group associations.
#' @param method Which type of index of associations to calculate:
#' \itemize{
#' \item 'sri' for Simple ratio index: \eqn{x \div x+yAB+yA+yB}
#' \item 'hw' for Half-weight index: \eqn{x/x+yAB+1/2(yA+yB)}
#' \item 'sr' for Square root index:\eqn{x/sqr((x+yAB+yA)(x+yAB+yB))}
#' }
#' @param perm number of permutations to perform.
#' @param progress a boolean indicating if the permutation process must be visible.
#' @return list of square association index matrices. The first element of the list is the non-permuted association index matrix.
#' @details Data stream permutation is a pre-network permutation approach. It is used on association data based on the gambit of the group.
