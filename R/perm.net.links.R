#' @title Matrix links permutations
#' @description Permutes matrix links.
#' @param M a square adjacency matrix or a list of square adjacency matrices.
#' @param sym if \emph{true} it vectorizes the lower triangle only .
#' @param erase.diag if \emph{true} it erases the diagonal of the matrix.
#' @param nperm number of permutations wanted.
#' @param progress a boolean indicating if the permutation process must be visible.
#' @details Edge permutations can be used to create random networks based on the observed network. Such permutation method is useful when analysing patterns of interaction such as assortativity.
#' @return list of square matrices of length nperm + 1.
