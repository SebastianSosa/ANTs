#' @description Creates a new column in the input data frame corresponding to the combination of given control factors.
#' @param df a data frame.
#' @param control a numeric or character vector representing one or more columns that are combined into one column of control factors.
#' @return The input data frame with an additional column named 'control', representing the control factors.
#' @details Control factors are used in permutation approaches to constrain the permutation between those factors.
