#' @title Geodesic distances and diameter
#' @description Calculates 1) Geodesic Distances and 2) network diameter .

#' @param m a square adjacency matrix.
#' @param weighted if \emph{FALSE}, it binarizes the square adjacency matrix M. Geodesic distances and diameter are based only on the presence or absence of edges.
#' @param shortest.weight if \emph{false}, it considers the higher met.strength as the shortest path.
#' @param normalization normalizes the weigths of the links i.e. divides them by the average strength of the network. Argument normalization can't be TRUE when  argument weighted is FALSE.
#' @param directed if \emph{false}, then it symmetrizes the matrix. Otherwise, it calculates geodesic distances and diameter according to the directionality of the links.
#' @param out if \emph{true}, it considers
#' @return A list of two elements:
#' \itemize{
#' \item The first element is the diameter of the network according to the option specified (weigthed or not, directed or not, throught shortest weights or stronger weights)
#' \item The second element is the geodesic distances between all nodes according to the option specified (weigthed or not, directed or not, throught shortest weights or stronger weights)
#' }

#' @details Binary network met.density is the ratio of existing links of a network in relation to all potential links.
