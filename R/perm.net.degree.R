#' @title Link permutation keeping the structure
#' @description Permutes the rows and/or the columns of a matrix to maintain the link structure during the permutation process.
#' @param M a square adjacency matrix or a list of square adjacency matrices.
#' @param nperm number of permutations wanted.
#' @return
#' \itemize{
#' \item A list of permuted matrices, if M is a single square adjacency matrix.
#' \item A list of a list of permuted matrices if M is a list of square adjacency matrices.
#' }
#' @details Link permutation maintaining the link structure, is usually used for matrix correlation or regression.
#' @author Sebastian Sosa, Ivan Puga-Gonzalez.
