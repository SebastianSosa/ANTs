#' @title Matrix to edge list
#' @description Converts a square adjacency matrix into a data frame of three columns representing an edge list. Columns are: actor, receiver and weight.

#' @param M a square adjacency matrix.
#' @param sym if \emph{TRUE}, it extracts the lower triangle of the matrix only.
#' @param erase.diag if \emph{TRUE}, it omits diagonals.
