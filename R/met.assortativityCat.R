#' @title Assortativity
#' @description Calculates the binary or weighted version of vertices Newman's assortativity for categorical or continuous attributes.
#' @param M a square adjacency matrix.
#' @param attr a factor or character vector indicating individuals categorical attributes appartenance.
#' @return an integer representing the categorical assortativity index of the network.
#' @details Assortativity (like the E-I index or the Moran 'I' statistic)  allows the study of homophily (preferential interaction between nodes with similar attributes) and heterophily (the preferential interaction between nodes with different attributes). Attributes can be individual characteristics such as sex or age, or individual node metrics such as the met.degree, in which case it is referred to as assortativity by vertex met.degree.
