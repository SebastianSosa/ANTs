#' @title Global efficiency
#' @description Calculates the global efficiency of a network.

#' @param m a square adjacency matrix.
#' @param weighted if \emph{false}, it binarizes the square adjacency matrix M. Geodesic distances and diameter are based only on the presence or absence of edges.
#' @param shortest.weight if \emph{false}, it considers the higher met.strength as the shortest path.
#' @param normalization normalizes the weigths of the links i.e. divides them by the average strength of the network.
#' @param directed if \emph{false}, it symmetrizes the matrix. Otherwise, it calculates geodesic distances and diameter according to the directionality of the links.
#' @param out if \emph{true}, it considers
#' @return An interger representing the global efficiency.


#' @details The global efficiency provides a measure of how efficiently information is exchanged in a network. It can be calculated in binary or weighted networks, and for undirected or directed networks. Depending on the problematic, care is needed for the choice of calculation method (binary or weighted, directed or undirected, and using the lowest or the highest met.strength as shortest path).
