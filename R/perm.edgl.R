#' @title Edge list link permutations on an edgelist
#' @description Permutes the links of an edge list represented by a data frame.
#' @param edgelist an edgelist
#' @param perm number of permutations to perform.
#' @return a list of edge lists with permuted links. The first element of the list is the original edge list.
#' @details edge list links permutations can be used to create random networks based on the observed network. Such permutation method is useful when analysing patterns of interactions such as assortativity.
