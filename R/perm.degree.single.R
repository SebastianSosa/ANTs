#' @title Link perm keeping structure on a single matrix
#' @description Permute row and/or columns of a matrix in order to keep links structure constant during perm.

#' @param M a square adjacency matrix or a list of square adjacency matrix.
#' @param perm number of perm wanted
#' @return
#' \itemize{
#' \item A list of prmuted matrices, if M is a single square adjacency matrix.
#' \item A list of list if M is a list of square adjacency matrix.
#' }
#' @details  Permutation of link and keeping link structure allow to study?????????
