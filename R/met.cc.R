#' @title Binary global clustering coefficient
#' @description Calculates the binary global clustering coefficient.
#' @param M a square adjacency matrix.
#' @return  An integer representing the binary global clustering coefficient index of the network.
#' @details The binary global clustering coefficient is the ratio of closed triplets to all triplets (open and closed) in a network. Triplets are three nodes connected by two or three undirected links (open or closed triplets, respectively).
