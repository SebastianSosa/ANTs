#' @description Creates an empty data frame with as many columns as in the corresponding matrix.
#' @param M a square adjacency matrix or a list of square adjacency matrices.
#' @param names a boolean, if \emph{true} then a column is added in the data frame with the names of the matrix columns.

#' \item if argument M is a matrix, then it creates a single empty data frame with as many rows as columns of the corresponding matrix.
#' \item if the argument M is a list of matrices, it creates a list of empty data frames with as many rows as columns of the corresponding matrix in the list.
