#' @title Confidence interval
#' @description Calculate 25, 50, 95 and 99 Confidence interval of a data set
#' @param x a numeric vector.
#' @param quantile numeric vector of probabilities with values in [0,1]. (Values up to 2e-14 outside that range are accepted and moved to the nearby endpoint.)
#' @return a numeric vector of length 2 with the lower and upper confidence interval.
#' @details Confidence interval allow to asses a level of certitude that the average of the 'population' is between a specific range.
